This is a graphical dynamic DNS update client for EnableDNS. It should run in the same manner on Linux, Windows and Mac as long as you have all the dependencies in place.

The setup.py file is for windows only, and will build a binary standalone package that you can run on any windows machine as long as you have Microsoft Visual C++. More on that later.

Dependencies:

- Python 2.7
- PyQt4
- python-ConfigObj
- python-requests
- py2exe (Windows only)

Linux:

Linux users can just download the entire repo and run EDnsUpdater.py. It will run as long as the dependencies above are met.

Windows:

For windows users I have made an installer that should work on any windows system. I have only tested it with Windows XP and Windows 7, but it should be fine on Vista as well.

If you plan on building it, please note that you will likely have to distribute the Microsoft Visual C++ runtime libraries along with it. Take extra care to include the same version that comes with the python 2.7 installation.

The files you will need are:

- msvcm90.dll
- msvcp90.dll
- msvcr90.dll

You will also have to create a manifest file (Microsoft.VC90.CRT.manifest). All these files will have to be copied in the same folder as the compiled app.

To build the self contained app open a cmd terminal and:

python.exe setup.py py2exe

A folder "dist" will be created in the same directory. Thats where you have to copy the dll's mentioned above.

Mac OSX:

Sorry, I do not have access to a Mac at the moment. In theory you can build a package similar to the windows package using py2app.
