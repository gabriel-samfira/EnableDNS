Here we will release some tools and code that might be usefull to our users. So far thi repo contains only one dynamic dns updater that works with EnableDNS. Feel free to have a look.

Right now it can only handle onedomain/subdomain, but it can easely be modified to handle multiple domains/subdomains.

It can be run as a cron job, or as a daemon. As a daemon it checks every 5 minutes for changes, and updates automatically as needed. Have a look at the help message for more details. This should work on any modern GNU/Linux instalation.


If you wish to contribute an example, please feel free to contact us. Contact information and development documentation can be found at:
