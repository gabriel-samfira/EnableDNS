Here we will release some tools and code that might be usefull to our users. 

We now have a graphical dynamic DNS updater that should work on any platform that has python and Qt4 installed. The old dynamic dns updater is still available and is ideal for servers.


The enableDns-updater script can be run as a cron job, or as a daemon. As a daemon it checks every 5 minutes for changes, and updates automatically as needed. Have a look at the help message for more details. This should work on any modern GNU/Linux instalation.

Please check

for information on the graphical version of the updater.
